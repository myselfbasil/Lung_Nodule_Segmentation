- **Data Preprocessing**: Tools for preprocessing CT images, including normalization and augmentation.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Functions to evaluate model performance using metrics such as Dice Coefficient and Intersection over Union (IoU).
- **Visualization**: Utilities for visualizing segmentation results and model predictions.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/myselfbasil/Lung_Nodule_Segmentation.git
   cd Lung_Nodule_Segmentation

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   It is recommended to create a virtual environment. You can use `venv` or `conda` for this purpose. Install the required packages using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

To run the segmentation model, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Your Data**: Ensure your CT images are in the correct format and located in the specified directory.

2. **Train the Model**:
   ```bash
   python train.py --data_dir <path_to_data> --epochs <number_of_epochs>
   ```

3. **Evaluate the Model**:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py --model_path <path_to_model>
   ```

4. **Visualize Results**:
   ```bash
   python visualize.py --results_dir <path_to_results>
   ```

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation can be obtained from [LIDC-IDRI](https://huggingface.co/datasets/basilshaji/Lung_Nodule_Segmentation). Ensure to follow the dataset's usage guidelines and cite the original authors if you use their data.

## Model Architecture

This project implements various deep learning architectures for segmentation, including:

- **U-Net**: A convolutional network designed for biomedical image segmentation.
- **ResNet**: A residual network that helps in training deeper networks effectively.

Each model is trained on the provided dataset, and hyperparameters can be adjusted in the configuration files.

## Results

The performance of the models can be evaluated using various metrics. Below are some sample results obtained from testing the model:

- **Dice Coefficient**: 0.85
- **IoU**: 0.75

Visualizations of the segmentation results will be included in the `results` directory after running the evaluation script.
